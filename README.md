Bonded by our shared childhood love of video games, we all had a common goal: to create something others could enjoy as much as we did. With this in mind, we combined our skills and brought this project to life.
Throughout the process, we challenged ourselves to create something that would not only be fun to play but also meaningful in its story and gameplay.

We are incredibly proud to share [Game]: an innovative 2d platforming experience created in the Godot engine using GDScript.
Across 3 towers set in a mysterious world, players will encounter over 150 skill-testing rooms, unique enemies & bosses, original hand-placed pixel art, 
and unique gameplay inspired by Celeste, Super Mario Bros, and Geometry Dash.
[Game] is a must-play if you are looking for a rewarding, authentic, and free-to-play experience!

## Gameplay

<br/><br/>
As an archaeologist tasked with retrieving treasured artifacts from a series of treacherous and mythical towers, players will face numerous obstacles and enemies, 
forcing them to act resourcefully and perform skillful maneuvers to surpass these harsh environments. 
<br/> <br/>
As the player continues to collect artifacts, they will be able to harness their rare properties to gain various physical advantages, access hidden areas, and gain special interactions with NPCs.

The gameplay in [game] has been carefully playtested and scrutinized to ensure that it feels fair and rewarding, with minimal glitches and bugs.
The player's movement physics is defined by over 15 parameters, which have been fined-tuned to make player movement feel smooth, accurate, and intuitive.

## Art
We are incredibly proud to say that 100% of the visuals in [Game] are original creations created by hand by our two talented artists, Fanelle Pang and Finnegan Van Dreumel.
<br/><br/>
Below is a showcase of some of their amazing work:

We are working on creating an upcoming release page on steam, and we will share that here as soon as it's available.
